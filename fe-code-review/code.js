/*Code Review Comment:
  I've tried to add some helpful comments for You among the code lines,
  Hovewer I need to summarize All I want You to think About:
  1. First of all this single function has a lot of responsibilities - You should focus on splitting code into some smaller pices with small goals
  2. You messed some Acess Logic, validation logic, controller logic and domain logic together - split the code thinking about layers of the Application. 
  - across the code review I tried to let You know where You should move the logic - so You could create some new compoenents and separate different app layers logic.
  3. This code is totally context-free and This-less. You could think about OOP  and transform code into classes and modules. 
  The code wouldnt be this messy, would be easier to read and track and would improve developer experience
  4. Once You split it into classes with single responsibility You should think about SOLID principles 
  - You can use some DI and reverse the depndencies tree. 
  - so Your code will be clean and You will reduce risk of legacy code and probably will extend the code's life cycle
  5. Name convention: names should be deccriptive so no one would misunderstand the logic under the hood
  6. Code should be self-explanatory - Mostly You shouldnt use comments in purpouse to explain code workflow
  - You shouldnt also comment code fragements: as I told earlier in the comment.
  7. DRY - Some repetitions can be observed in the code, such as updating the request status (`db.updateStatus`) in different parts of the function. 
  - Consider extracting these parts into separate helper functions to reduce repetitions and improve code readability.
  8. Adding error handling can facilitate debugging and code improvement. 
  - Ensure that each function handles possible errors and returns appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages.
  9. Make sure Async actions are wrapped with try/catch or You provode some error catching
  10. Summary: After You provide changes, check if You can answer these questions when reading the file:
  - what is the communication between compoenents? Do You know the directions of communication and its purposes?
  - what is a flow of current compoenent?
  - what is a result of current component?
  - what context does current compoenent have?

  WHDYT about my propositons?
  These are only suggestions - let me know if you need any explanation or help in refactoring that code - I would be happy to do that :)
